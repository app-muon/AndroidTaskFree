## Features

### Privacy and control
- Free and open source.
- No ads, tracking, or data sharing.
- Works without permissions (only needed for notifications).
- Manual backup and restore included.
- Optionally encrypt your data.
  -   Android automatically saves app data to your Google account so it can be restored when you set up a new phone. Most apps let Google see this data as it isnâ€™t encrypted. TaskFree gives you the option to encrypt your   backup with a recovery phrase, so the data is still saved to your Google account for convenience, but only you can read it. This means your tasks stay private even if you change or restore your phone.

### Task management
- Add due dates and repeating tasks with reminders.  
- Organise tasks into categories.  
- Filter and search by category, due date, status, or text.  
- Archive completed tasks to keep lists tidy.  

### Clean design
- Simple, distraction-free interface.  
- Dark mode included.  
- Adjustable text size.  
- Works on phones and tablets.
