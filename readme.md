# TaskFree for Android

A is a free, ad-free, and open-source task manager. No data is shared with us,
advertisers, or any third parties — only with Google.

Create tasks by category, add due dates, and set notifications.
You can even make tasks repeat, for example every Friday. It’s easy to see what’s due,
filter your list, and mark tasks as \"pending\" \"doing\", or \"done\".

Like most apps, TaskFree syncs with your Google account. This means your tasks follow you
when you switch phones. You can encrypt this synced data, if you want to keep it private.
